<h2>ARTICLE 1</h2>
<h3>Bid Application</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6"><br>Section I:<br> The delegation from PAWNEE (People of Atlanta, Washington, iNdiana, and Everywhere Else), representing the Pawnee Municipal Government, shall be accepted into competition at the Sunbreak tournament 2018. After being born in Pawnee  most members of the delegation attended the Georgia Institute of Technology located in Atlanta, Georgia. Many members left the institute following commencement and wandered across the country stretching from coast to coast.
<br>Section II:<br> Members of the delegation have represented either Georgia Tech Tribe or Wreck from 2012 to 2018. Or have some close association to that group of friends.
<br>Section III: <br>In addendum to Section II members may have also played for the mixed team, Tribeck. Past tournaments we have attended include: Lei Out, Wildwood, College Mixed Nationals (when that was like, a thing), and the Bama Secs Beach Party (the premier national southern US spring college tournament).  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <br>Section IV:<br> The team boasts a high level of play both at the party and at the pregame before the party. On field skills are far from lacking but by the end of game one we will be laser focused on our goal: to replicate Nick Lance’s scoober  on every line.  Members of PAWNEE have played on many high level teams so we can mix serious play with pleasure. These teams include: Underground, Ozone, Team Australia U23, Brickyard, Jello Yackets, Tribeck.
<br> Section V: <br> Members of the legendary 2012 collegiate national co-spirit champions will be on hand to ensure a fun, safe, and enjoyable weekend for all. We may go 1-6 on the field but in the end, we’ll tie with Minnesota-Duluth in spirit. Just how it was planned.
<br>Section VI: <br>In addition, we have delegates from our sister city of Sydney, Australia who are coming to prepare for the WUCC2018 with their club team: Friskee. Not only will their appearance strengthen the bonds between our two great cities, but also will make us overall friskier. Unfortunately, representatives from our other sister city Baroqua, Venezuela were unable to make it. When asked they said that our city was “an embarrassment to America” and they would not like to play in our “giant pit of dirt.” </div>
